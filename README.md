<h1>Dbank</h1>
<br>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>This is a decentralized banking system built on the Internet Computer using the Motoko programming language, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer funds to other accounts, and view their transaction history. The system is fully decentralized, meaning that transactions are executed on the Internet Computer blockchain, without the need for intermediaries such as banks.</p>
